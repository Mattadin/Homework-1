# Homework-1

*For this project, I was asked to meet accessibility criteria and create proper semantics for the CSS without changing the layout or styling of the website.*

*However, upon reviewing the code, there were numerous ineffeciencies within the HTML and CSS. I began by breaking the project down into a few simple steps:*

**1) Create accessibility by assigning alt tags to images and applying better semantics while meeting WCAG standards while also not interfering with the website style.**

**2) Restore functionality to the links at the top of the page to ensure all functions of the website are working as intended.**

**3) Consolidating the HTML and CSS code to be more concise and easier to understand.**

**4) Leaving comments and re-organizing the order in which the code is written to ensure future retrofits will be a smoother process.**

*Upon completing task 1, I was able to test viability using a series of extensions that grade the accessibility against WCAG standards and use a screen reader to ensure everything reads easily for those who are vision impaired.*

*Moving to task 2, I noticed one of the ID's for the linking of the item at the top of the page links properly to the content in the bottom of the page as originally intended.*

*Task 3 was much more challenging. The CSS contained several classes that all performed the same function and completely swamped the HTML and made it sloppy. By consolidating the various groups that all perform identical functions and renaming all classes and ID's to more concisely describe their function (most notably formatting) I was able to make the code much cleaner and easier.*

*With all other tasks complete, task 4 became very simple as some code simply needed some moving around for a simple and intuitive flow from element selectors to class selectors and formatting classes being grouped together which will make future work much simpler.*
